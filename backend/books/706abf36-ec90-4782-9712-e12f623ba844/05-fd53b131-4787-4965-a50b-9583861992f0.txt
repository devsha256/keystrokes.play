Your success in life and work will be determined by the kinds of habits that
you develop over time. The habit of setting priorities, overcoming
procrastination, and getting on with your most important task is a mental
and physical skill. As such, this habit is learnable through practice and
repetition, over and over again, until it locks into your subconscious mind
and becomes a permanent part of your behavior. Once it becomes a habit, it
becomes both automatic and easy to do.
This habit of starting and completing important tasks has an immediate
and continuous payoff. You are designed mentally and emotionally in such
a way that task completion gives you a positive feeling. It makes you happy.
It makes you feel like a winner.
Whenever you complete a task of any size or importance, you feel a
surge of energy, enthusiasm, and self-esteem. The more important the
completed task, the happier, more confident, and more powerful you feel
about yourself and your world.
The completion of an important task triggers the release of endorphins in
your brain. These endorphins give you a natural “high.” The endorphin rush
that follows successful completion of any task makes you feel more
positive, personable, creative, and confident.
