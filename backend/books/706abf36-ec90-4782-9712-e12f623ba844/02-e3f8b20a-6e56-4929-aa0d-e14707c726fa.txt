For this reason, and perhaps more than ever before, your ability to select
your most important task at each moment, and then to get started on that
task and to get it done both quickly and well, will probably have more of an
impact on your success than any other quality or skill you can develop.
An average person who develops the habit of setting clear priorities and
getting important tasks completed quickly will run circles around a genius
who talks a lot and makes wonderful plans but who gets very little done.
