In study after study of men and women who get paid more and promoted
faster, the quality of “action orientation” stands out as the most observable
and consistent behavior they demonstrate in everything they do. Successful,
effective people are those who launch directly into their major tasks and
then discipline themselves to work steadily and single-mindedly until those
tasks are complete.
“Failure to execute” is one of the biggest problems in organizations
today. Many people confuse activity with accomplishment. They talk
continually, hold endless meetings, and make wonderful plans, but in the
final analysis, no one does the job and gets the results required.
