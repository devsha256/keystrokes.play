This is a wonderful time to be alive. There have never been more
possibilities and opportunities for you to achieve more of your goals than
exist today. As perhaps never before in human history, you are actually
drowning in options. In fact, there are so many good things that you can do
that your ability to decide among them may be the critical determinant of
what you accomplish in life.
If you are like most people today, you are overwhelmed with too much
to do and too little time. As you struggle to get caught up, new tasks and
responsibilities just keep rolling in, like the waves of the ocean. Because of
this, you will never be able to do everything you have to do. You will never
be caught up. You will always be behind in some of your tasks and
responsibilities, and probably in many of them.
