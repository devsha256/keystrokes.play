It has been said that if the first thing you do each morning is to eat a live
frog, you can go through the day with the satisfaction of knowing that that
is probably the worst thing that is going to happen to you all day long.
Your “frog” is your biggest, most important task, the one you are most
likely to procrastinate on if you don’t do something about it. It is also the
one task that can have the greatest positive impact on your life and results at
the moment.
The first rule of frog eating is this: If you have to eat two frogs, eat the
ugliest one first.
This is another way of saying that if you have two important tasks before
you, start with the biggest, hardest, and most important task first. Discipline
yourself to begin immediately and then to persist until the task is complete
before you go on to something else.
Think of this as a test. Treat it like a personal challenge. Resist the
temptation to start with the easier task. Continually remind yourself that one
of the most important decisions you make each day is what you will do
immediately and what you will do later, if you do it at all.
The second rule of frog eating is this: If you have to eat a live frog at all, it
doesn’t pay to sit and look at it for very long.
The key to reaching high levels of performance and productivity is to
develop the lifelong habit of tackling your major task first thing each
morning. You must develop the routine of “eating your frog” before you do
anything else and without taking too much time to think about it.
