There’s this place near my house—a boxing gym called Hard Knox. Any day you want,
you can go there, sit down, and watch people fight.
The sign above the door says “VIP ENTRANCE,” because anyone who enters can be a
champion. But to become one, you have to learn how to get hit.
In a fight, there is a fundamental difference between boxers and everyone else. The
guys who have trained are different. If you hit them, they don’t flinch. It takes practice to
get there, but if you want to fight, you have no choice. It’s the only way to win.
This is a book about being a champion, and what it takes to get there. It’s about
decisions, and how to know when you’re making the right ones. It’s also about you: the
current, present you; the potential, future you; and the one, single difference between
them.
It’s about an instinct—the flinch—and why mastering it is vital.
This book is about how to stop flinching. It’s about facing pain.
