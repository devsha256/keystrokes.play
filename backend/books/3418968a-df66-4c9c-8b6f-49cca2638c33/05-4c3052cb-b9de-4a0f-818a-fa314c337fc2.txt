Somewhere in the world, a lion wakes up every morning not knowing what it’s going to
eat. Every day, it finds food. The lion isn’t worried—it just does what it needs to do.
Somewhere else, in a zoo, a caged lion sits around every day and waits for a
zookeeper. The lion is comfortable. It gets to relax. It’s not worried much, either.
Both of these animals are lions. Only one is a king.
You’re dropped into a forest—alone—at night. Can you survive? Sure. Do you stop
caring about your 401k? Definitely. Within 48 hours, you’re left with the flinches that
help you survive.
Everything but what’s useful for survival drops away. The flinch is an ally again. This is
what we’re looking for—reprogramming.
Let’s make a list of the fears you were born with: falling; abandonment; loud noises….
Yeah, that’s about it. You were born with these fears because you need them to survive.
These fears kept you safe.
The rest are just ghost stories that the flinch has taken over. They’re signposts. Look for
them. They point the way toward barriers you need to pass, to doors you need to open.
