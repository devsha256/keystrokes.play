Before the bicycle helmet, the seat belt, and the bulletproof vest, there was the flinch.
The flinch is like the Moro reflex, which protects infants from falling. Flinching guards
you from the unexpected. It protects your eyes and neck. It’s one of the few instincts
you’re born with, and keep, all your life.
In any accident, the most lacerated, damaged parts of a victim’s body are the hands.
This is because the flinch is your personal goalie. It protects you from a bear, a bully, or
a baseball. Anytime it’s needed, the flinch surfaces, using your hands to protect
essential body parts from damage.
Car crashes. Bike accidents. Explosions. In moments like these, you need the flinch. It’s
why you survive the unexpected. If you’ve ever been jumped, you know this. Human
beings need the flinch to live.
Or do they? In your daily life, you might never experience anything dangerous at all.
Your life is safe—but you’re flinching anyway. You don’t flinch at bears, because there
are none. But you do flinch at the prospect of speaking publicly or joining a gym. You
flinch at the doctor’s office. You even flinch for sitcom characters. Anytime there’s
potential change, there’s a flinch, whether it’s a threat or not.
You think the flinch is natural, and part of your life, which it is. But have you ever asked
yourself why your stomach tenses up and you can’t watch imaginary characters on a
television screen do awkward, embarrassing things? You should.
